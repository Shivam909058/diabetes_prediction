# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for better health outcomes. This project presents a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various medical measurements.

## Introduction

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm capable of both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in a high-dimensional feature space. SVM has been widely used in medical diagnostics due to its ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains medical measurements such as glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, and age, along with a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

### Workflow
**Data Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and standardize features.
**Model Creation**: An SVM classifier is trained using the processed data to predict diabetes outcomes.
**Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
**Model Improvement**: Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods are employed to enhance the model's performance.
**Deployment**: The final model is deployed for making predictions on new data.

### Libraries Used

## Results

The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 79% on the training dataset and 79% on the testing dataset. Further improvements were made using hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods, resulting in enhanced predictive performance.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements could include exploring more advanced machine learning models, collecting additional relevant features, or integrating real-time data for continuous model refinement. Additionally, deploying the model as a web application or integrating it into healthcare systems could facilitate widespread use and accessibility.

## Conclusion

Early detection of diabetes is essential for timely intervention and better patient outcomes. The SVM model presented in this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting diabetes based on medical measurements. By leveraging advanced algorithms and techniques, we can contribute to improved healthcare decision-making and patient care.
